# space_invader
This is a game that I made in python using pygame library

It is a multiplayer game where the second player is controlled by another human(yet).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTROLS:
Player_1(Yellow Spaceship)
W/A/S/D Keys for up, left, down right, press G to shoot

Player_2(Red Spaceship)
UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT for its movement and press L to shoot

There can be maximum three bullets shot by each player at a time and the respective player can't shoot more bullets until one of the three bullets go out of screen 
or it collides with the enemy player.
